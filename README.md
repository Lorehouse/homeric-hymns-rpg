## The Homeric Hymns RPG

The goal of this project is to create a simple RPG as a creative project for Signum University's Classical Myths and Legends class.
The player will have the opportunity to gain weapons, fight mythical monsters, solve some simple puzzles, and find their wyrd... no, wrong language. Fate. Μοῖρα.
To do this, I will have to learn how to use Python classes properly, learn to write some simple HTML, display images, and maybe persist user data. Not sure about that yet.
